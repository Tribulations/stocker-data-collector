## System Description
*The description below was generated by [SDG](https://github.com/Tribulations/system-description-generator)*

Here's a structured summary of the stocker-backend system:

1. **System Purpose**
   The system is a backend service for stock market data management, specifically designed to fetch, parse, and store financial trading data from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Key Components & Responsibilities**
   - Data Fetching Layer: `YahooFinanceFetcher` handles API communication with Yahoo Finance
   - Parsing Layer: `YahooFinanceParser` and `BaseParser` process raw financial data
   - Data Access Layer: `CandlestickDao` manages database operations for stock data
   - Service Layer: `StockDataService` orchestrates data fetching, parsing, and storage
   - Model Layer: `Stock`, `Candlestick`, and `TradingPeriod` represent financial data entities
   - Database Management: `DatabaseManager` and `MigrationManager` handle database connections and schema updates

3. **Core Technologies & Dependencies**
   - Java as the primary programming language
   - JDBC for database operations
   - Flyway for database migrations
   - SLF4J for logging
   - Google Gson for JSON processing
   - HTTP Client for API communications
   - Dotenv for environment configuration

4. **Architecture**
The system follows a layered architecture:
   - Presentation Layer (not visible in the provided code)
   - Service Layer (StockDataService)
   - Data Access Layer (DAOs)
   - Infrastructure Layer (Database, HTTP clients)
   - The design implements separation of concerns with distinct components for fetching, parsing, and storing data.

5. **Data Flow**
   1. YahooFinanceFetcher retrieves raw financial data from Yahoo Finance API
   2. YahooFinanceParser processes the raw JSON data into domain objects
   3. StockDataService coordinates the data processing pipeline
   4. CandlestickDao persists the processed data to the database
   5. Validation occurs at multiple points through DataFetcherInputValidator and DatabaseInputValidator

The system employs error handling, input validation, and logging throughout the data processing pipeline to ensure reliable operation.

## Requirements

- Docker is required to run tests as these use testcontainers
